/**
 * Apply pending Drizzle migrations, then exit.
 * Used as the container start command (see railway.json) so a fresh
 * production database is migrated automatically on every deploy.
 * Runs with plain Node - no CLI tooling needed at runtime.
 *
 * Multi-replica safety: takes a Postgres advisory lock so that when several
 * containers start simultaneously (rolling deploy), only one runs the
 * migrations; the others block until it finishes, then exit.
